### Spionage

## Introduction

### Purpose

To build a decentralised digital forensic platform to perform forensic analysis for systems and evaluate results. This ensures the accuracy and the trusworthyness of results.
Executing these scripts using a decentralised platform ensues fairness, tranparency and aiming to achieve unbaised results. Metadata from a digital forensic analysis will be stored on chain and the validator nodes will get incentivised for 
* each block they are validating
* each script they are exeuting ( for number of bytes and the time and efficiency )
* ability to complete the analysis within the consensus timeframes.

### Tech Stack
* Python
* Linux Bash
* Rust
* Selected blockchain infrastructure
* Machine learning framework
